# 🚨 CRITICAL YAML FIX REQUIRED

## 🎯 **The Problem**
The `.github/workflows/autonomous-ci-cd.yml` file has corrupted YAML structure around the "Upload deployment logs" step (lines 380-392).

## 🔧 **Exact Fix Required**

**Replace lines 380-392 with this exact block:**

```yaml
      - name: 📤 Upload deployment logs
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: deploy-logs-${{ github.run_id }}
          path: deployment/logs/**
          retention-days: 7
```

## 🛠️ **VS Code Steps**

1. **Open the file**: `.github/workflows/autonomous-ci-cd.yml`
2. **Go to line 380** (around the "Upload deployment logs" step)
3. **Delete the entire malformed step** (lines 380-392)
4. **Paste the exact block above**
5. **Save the file**

## 🔍 **What Went Wrong**
- The step has **wrong indentation** (too many spaces)
- **Duplicate `if:` keys** causing YAML parser confusion
- **Malformed structure** from previous edit attempts

## ✅ **Expected Result**
After this fix, the step should:
- ✅ **Align properly** with other steps under `steps:`
- ✅ **Have only one `if:` key**
- ✅ **Use correct 2-space indentation**
- ✅ **Parse without YAML errors**

## 🚀 **You're Almost There!**
Once this YAML fix is applied, you'll have a **legendary, Fortune-500-grade autonomous TMS pipeline** that's completely bulletproof! 🏆✨
