# üåê How to See Real-Time Updates on http://localhost:8084/

## ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### **1. Open Your Website**
- Go to: **http://localhost:8084/**
- You should see your TMS website homepage

### **2. Navigate to Dashboard**
- Look for a **"Dashboard"** link in the navigation menu
- Or go directly to: **http://localhost:8084/dashboard**

### **3. Scroll Down to See Real-Time Updates**
On the dashboard page, you'll see **TWO sections** showing real-time updates:

#### **Section 1: Real-Time Agent Monitor**
- Shows autonomous agent status
- Displays agent activity in real-time
- Shows connection status to autonomous system

#### **Section 2: Website Builder Monitor** ‚≠ê **THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT!**
- **Header:** "üèóÔ∏è Website Builder Monitor"
- **Connection Status:** Green dot showing "connected"
- **Stats Cards:** Total builds, active agents, files modified
- **Website Files Being Built:** List of files being created/modified
- **Live Build Updates:** Real-time feed of agent actions
- **"Trigger Build" button:** Click to start new build processes

### **4. What You'll See in Real-Time:**
- **File Creation Updates:** New pages, components, styles being created
- **Agent Activity:** Which agents are working on what tasks
- **Build Statistics:** Count of total builds and active agents
- **Live Feed:** Real-time updates every few seconds

### **5. If You Don't See the Monitors:**
- **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
- **Make sure the website is running** on port 8084

### **6. Alternative Pages to Check:**
- **Autonomous Dashboard:** http://localhost:8084/autonomous-dashboard
- **Main Dashboard:** http://localhost:8084/dashboard

## üéØ **Expected Real-Time Updates:**

You should see updates like:
- "PageBuilder: Created new page: autonomous-dashboard.tsx"
- "ContentWriter: Updated dashboard with autonomous building indicator"
- "ComponentCreator: Created new component: AutonomousComponent.tsx"
- "StyleUpdater: Created autonomous styles: autonomous.css"

## üîß **Troubleshooting:**

If you don't see real-time updates:
1. **Check if autonomous agents are running:** The WebSocket server should be active on port 8085
2. **Check browser console:** Look for WebSocket connection errors
3. **Refresh the page:** Sometimes the connection needs to be re-established

## üì± **Mobile View:**
The real-time monitors are also visible on mobile devices - just scroll down on the dashboard page.

**üí° Tip:** The real-time updates appear every few seconds, so keep the dashboard page open to see the autonomous agents working in real-time!
