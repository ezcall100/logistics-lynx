  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed"
}
```

### 5. CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` already configured
- **Automated Testing**: Runs on push and pull requests
- **Port Configuration**: Uses port 8084 for testing

# Run headed (visible browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### CI/CD
- Automatically runs on GitHub Actions
