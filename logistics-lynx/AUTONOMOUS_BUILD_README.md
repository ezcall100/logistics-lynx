# ðŸ¤– Autonomous Build System

This system enables autonomous agents to build, test, and deploy the application without human intervention.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Single Autonomous Build
```bash
npm run autonomous:build
```

### 2. Continuous Autonomous Agent
```bash
npm run autonomous:continuous
```

### 3. Health Check
```bash
npm run health:check
```

## ðŸ“‹ System Components

### 1. Autonomous Build System (`scripts/autonomous-build.mjs`)
- **Health Check**: Verifies system requirements
- **Dependency Installation**: Clean install with security audit
- **Testing**: Unit tests, portal checks, TypeScript validation
- **Building**: Development and production builds
- **Deployment**: Automatic staging deployment
- **Reporting**: Detailed build reports with success metrics

### 2. Continuous Autonomous Agent (`scripts/autonomous-agent-continuous.mjs`)
- **File Monitoring**: Watches for code changes
- **Git Integration**: Detects uncommitted changes
- **Periodic Checks**: Runs builds every 5 minutes if needed
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to files
- **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive builds

### 3. Health Check System (`scripts/health-check.mjs`)
- **File System**: Verifies critical files and directories
- **Portal Accessibility**: Tests all portal routes
- **Deprecated Routes**: Validates 410 responses
- **Reporting**: Generates health reports

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/autonomous-build.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push, PR, scheduled (every 6 hours), manual
- **Build Pipeline**: Automated build and test
- **Deployment**: Staging and production deployments
- **Monitoring**: Post-deployment health checks
- **Artifacts**: Build artifacts and logs retention

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Build Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
CI=true

# Application URLs
APP_URL=http://localhost:8084
APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8084

# Authentication (for portal checks)
APP_COOKIE=your-session-cookie
```

### Build Intervals
- **Continuous Agent**: 5 minutes between builds
- **GitHub Actions**: Every 6 hours (scheduled)
- **File Change Debounce**: 2 seconds

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Reporting

### Build Reports
Location: `build-reports/autonomous-build-{timestamp}.json`
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "duration": "45s",
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "summary": {
    "totalSteps": 12,
    "errors": 0,
    "successRate": "100.0%"
  }
}
```

### Health Reports
Location: `health-reports/health-check-{timestamp}.json`
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "summary": {
    "total": 25,
    "successful": 25,
    "failed": 0,
    "successRate": "100.0%"
  }
}
```

### Agent Logs
Location: `logs/autonomous-agent.log`
```
[2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] [agent-1705312200000] [INFO] Starting autonomous build
[2024-01-15T10:30:05.000Z] [agent-1705312200000] [INFO] âœ… Build completed successfully
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

### 1. Development Workflow
```bash
# Start continuous agent during development
npm run autonomous:continuous

# Make code changes - builds trigger automatically
# Check logs for build status
tail -f logs/autonomous-agent.log
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# GitHub Actions automatically runs on:
# - Push to main/develop
# - Pull requests
# - Every 6 hours (scheduled)
# - Manual trigger
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```bash
# Manual production deployment
# Go to GitHub Actions â†’ Autonomous Build & Deploy â†’ Run workflow
# Select environment: production
```

### 4. Health Monitoring
```bash
# Regular health checks
npm run health:check

# Check portal accessibility
npm run check:portals
```
