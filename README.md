## 🏆 Enterprise-Grade Autonomous TMS

A fully autonomous Transportation Management System with zero-downtime deployment capabilities, powered by AI-driven decision making and comprehensive CI/CD automation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Pipeline Self-Test (Safe Dry Run)
```bash
gh workflow run "Pipeline Self-Test"
```

### Deploy to Staging
```bash
gh workflow run "Autonomous CI/CD Pipeline" -f environment=staging
```

### Deploy to Production
```bash
gh workflow run "Autonomous CI/CD Pipeline" -f environment=production
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
gh workflow run "Autonomous CI/CD Pipeline" -f environment=production -f rollback=true
```
