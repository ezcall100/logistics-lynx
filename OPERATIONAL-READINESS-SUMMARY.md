- **Soft Degrade:** Graceful throttling without full shutdown
- **Resume Procedures:** Post-incident recovery workflows
- **Feature Flag Management:** Runtime configuration control

### ‚úÖ Monitoring & Alerting
- **Real-time Metrics:** Success rate, latency, queue depth
- **SLO Monitoring:** 98% success rate, ‚â§2.5s P95 latency targets
- **DLQ Monitoring:** Dead letter queue depth tracking
- **Outbox Lag:** Event processing latency monitoring

### ‚úÖ Automated Scripts
- **Green Posture Script:** Comprehensive health checks
- **Acceptance Testing:** Synthetic task validation
- **Resilience Drills:** Weekly automated testing
- **Incident Response:** Automated triage and recovery

## üìã Operational Procedures

### Daily Ritual (5 minutes)
```bash
node scripts/green-posture-script.js
psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -c "select count(*) dlq_depth from public.dlq_items;"
psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -c "select cron.jobid, schedule from cron.job where jobname like 'agent_logs_%';"
```

### Incident Response (15 minutes)
1. **Triage (2 min):** Run green posture check
2. **Contain (1-3 min):** Apply soft degrade if needed
3. **Prove (2 min):** Run acceptance testing
4. **Recover (5-8 min):** Gradual scale-up under SLO gates

### Weekly Maintenance (30 minutes)
```bash
node scripts/resilience-drills.js
# Verify CI security jobs
# Check canary ramp status
```

## üéØ Key Performance Indicators

### Target Metrics
- **Success Rate:** ‚â• 98%
- **P95 Latency:** ‚â§ 2.5s
- **DLQ Depth:** Steady/clearing
- **Outbox Lag:** P95 < 5s
- **Agent Queue:** < 100 items

### Alert Thresholds
- Success rate drops below 95%
- P95 latency exceeds 5s
- DLQ depth > 50 items
- Outbox lag P95 > 10s
- Agent queue > 200 items

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Critical Situations
1. **System Overload:** Apply soft degrade, then scale down
2. **High Error Rate:** Emergency stop, investigate, gradual recovery
3. **External Dependency Failure:** Quarantine tool, retry later
4. **Data Corruption:** Emergency stop, restore from backup

### Recovery Steps
1. **Assess:** Run sanity ping to understand current state
2. **Contain:** Apply appropriate controls (stop/degrade)
3. **Investigate:** Check logs and metrics for root cause
4. **Fix:** Address underlying issue
5. **Verify:** Run acceptance testing
6. **Recover:** Gradual scale-up under monitoring
