# 🔧 YAML Indentation Fix Notes

## Issue Identified
There's a YAML indentation/line ending issue in the `.github/workflows/autonomous-ci-cd.yml` file around the "Upload deployment logs" step.

## Root Cause
- Malformed `run:` block that didn't end properly
- Inconsistent indentation (mixing tabs/spaces)
- Possible CRLF line endings causing parser confusion

## Quick Fix Required
Replace the problematic region (around lines 378-392) with this exact structure:

```yaml
      - name: 📤 Upload deployment logs
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: deploy-logs-${{ github.run_id }}
          path: |
            ./deployment/logs/**
            ./deployment/*.log
          retention-days: ${{ needs.preflight.outputs.target-environment == 'production' && 90 || 14 }}
```

## Key Points
- **2-space indentation** per level
- **LF line endings** (not CRLF)
- **Proper step alignment** under `steps:`
- **Clean run: block termination** before the next step

## VS Code Fix Steps
1. **Convert line endings**: Status bar → CRLF → LF → Save
2. **Normalize indentation**: Command Palette → "Convert Indentation to Spaces" → set 2
3. **Reveal whitespace**: View → Command Palette → "Render Whitespace" → all
4. **Delete and retype** any problematic spaces before `- name:`
