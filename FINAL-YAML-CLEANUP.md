# 🎯 FINAL YAML CLEANUP

## 🎉 **Great News!**
The "Context access might be invalid" warnings are now **GONE**! ✅

## 🔧 **Remaining Issue**
There are still some YAML structure errors around line 405. These are likely from the previous edit attempts.

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix**

**Option 1: Manual Cleanup**
1. **Open** `.github/workflows/autonomous-ci-cd.yml`
2. **Go to line 405** (around the health-check job)
3. **Check for malformed indentation** - ensure all steps align properly
4. **Fix any stray spaces/tabs** before `- name:`

**Option 2: VS Code Auto-Fix**
1. **Convert line endings**: Status bar → CRLF → LF → Save
2. **Normalize indentation**: Command Palette → "Convert Indentation to Spaces" → set 2
3. **Reveal whitespace**: View → Command Palette → "Render Whitespace" → all
4. **Delete and retype** any problematic spaces
