# Autonomous Agents TMS Understanding & Implementation

## Summary
The autonomous agents have been successfully configured to understand that the Carrier Portal is NOT just a simple portal, but a comprehensive TMS (Transportation Management System) for carriers with role-based access control and full operational management capabilities.

## What Autonomous Agents Now Understand

### 1. TMS vs Simple Portal Distinction
**Before**: Agents thought of carrier portal as basic web interface
**Now**: Agents understand it's a complete TMS with:
- Fleet management and vehicle tracking
- Load management and assignment
- Route optimization and planning
- Driver management and scheduling
- Financial management and reporting
- Maintenance scheduling and tracking
- Compliance management (DOT, ELD, Safety)
- Real-time analytics and insights

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Agents now implement different interfaces for:

#### Fleet Manager Role
- Full TMS access with comprehensive fleet management
- Route optimization and analytics
- Driver and load management
- Performance monitoring

#### Dispatcher Role
- Load assignment and driver management
- Real-time tracking and scheduling
- Communication coordination

#### Driver Role
- Personal dashboard with load details
- Route information and compliance tracking
- Earnings and document access

#### Owner/Operator Role
- Business management and financial tracking
- Maintenance oversight and analytics
- Compliance and reporting

#### Admin Role
- User management and system configuration
- Reports and audit logs
- Compliance oversight
