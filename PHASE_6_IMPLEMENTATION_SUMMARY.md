## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Multi-Region System
```
Primary Region (Active) ←→ Health Monitor ←→ Secondary Region (Standby)
       ↓                        ↓                        ↓
   User Traffic           Auto Failover            Backup Ready
```

### Usage Monitoring System
```
Usage Events → Nightly Monitor → Breach Detection → Notifications
     ↓              ↓                ↓                ↓
  Real-time    Daily Scan      Alert Creation    Slack/Email
