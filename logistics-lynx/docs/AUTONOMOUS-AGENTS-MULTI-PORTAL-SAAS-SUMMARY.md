## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables for multi-portal SaaS
portals (key, title, path)
portal_features (portal_key, feature_key, kind)
plan_components (plan, feature_key, included, monthly_quota, soft_cap, hard_cap)
price_components (feature_key, component, amount_cents, tiers)
org_addons (org_id, feature_key, seats, enabled, started_at, expires_at)
org_trials (org_id, feature_key, ends_at)
usage_events (org_id, feature_key, qty, at, meta)
```

### Access Control Functions
```sql
-- Portal access check
can_access_portal(org_id, portal_key) â†’ boolean

-- Feature usage check with quotas
can_use_feature(org_id, feature_key) â†’ boolean
```

### Middleware Implementation
```typescript
// Portal access middleware
requirePortal(portalKey: string)

// Feature quota middleware  
requireFeatureWithQuota(featureKey: string, qty: number)
```

## Customer Types & Access Patterns

### Free Organizations
- **Access**: Core portals only (Broker, Shipper, Carrier, Driver)
- **Limitations**: 1,000 ops/month per feature
- **UI**: Premium tabs show as "Locked" with upgrade CTAs
- **API**: Returns 402 for gated features

### Professional Organizations
- **Access**: Core + premium features
- **Quotas**: 5,000-10,000 ops/month
- **Performance**: p95 â‰¤ 2.5s across portals
- **Features**: Real-time analytics, CRM automation, dynamic rating

### Enterprise Organizations
- **Access**: Everything except add-ons
- **Quotas**: Unlimited for most features
- **Features**: White-label options, dedicated support
- **Add-ons**: EDI, predictive pricing, autonomous AI (optional)
