## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If System Goes Down
1. **Check health endpoint**: `curl https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/health`
2. **Review n8n logs**: Check for workflow failures
3. **Pause agent-runner**: Stop cron if cascading failures
4. **Check database**: Verify connectivity and performance
5. **Rollback if needed**: Use blue/green deployment switch
