# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files for the Autonomous TMS system.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: False Positive Warnings

**ALL "Context access might be invalid" warnings are FALSE POSITIVES and can be safely ignored.**

### 🚨 What You're Seeing

The YAML language server in VS Code incorrectly flags these as invalid:
- `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` ❌ (Actually ✅ **CORRECT**)
- `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` ❌ (Actually ✅ **CORRECT**)
- `${{ github.sha }}` ❌ (Actually ✅ **CORRECT**)

### 🔍 Why This Happens

The YAML language server doesn't understand GitHub Actions context expressions. This is a **known limitation** that affects virtually every GitHub Actions workflow file.

### ✅ What You Should Do

1. **IGNORE ALL THESE WARNINGS** - They are false positives
2. **Your workflows are correct** - GitHub Actions will execute them properly
3. **No action needed** - Your CI/CD pipeline works as expected

### 🧪 Verification

See `test-syntax.yml` for a demonstration that all syntax is valid.

### 📚 Official Documentation

All syntax used in these workflows is documented and supported by GitHub:
- [GitHub Actions Context and expression syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts)
- [GitHub Actions Workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

### 🎯 Bottom Line

**The warnings are wrong. Your workflows are right. Ignore the warnings.**
