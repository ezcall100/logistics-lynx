## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### 1. Database Setup

Run the migration to create all required tables:

```bash
# Apply the risk management schema
supabase db push
```

### 2. Component Integration

Add the onboarding component to your routes:

```tsx
import CarrierBrokerRiskReview from '@/components/onboarding/CarrierBrokerRiskReview';

// In your router
<Route path="/onboarding" element={<CarrierBrokerRiskReview />} />
```

### 3. Admin Dashboard Setup

Add the admin dashboard for review management:

```tsx
import OnboardingReviewDashboard from '@/components/admin/OnboardingReviewDashboard';

// In your admin routes
<Route path="/admin/onboarding-reviews" element={<OnboardingReviewDashboard />} />
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Add required environment variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# FMCSA API (if available)
FMCSA_API_KEY=your_fmcsa_api_key
FMCSA_API_URL=https://api.fmcsa.dot.gov

# IRS TIN Verification (if available)
IRS_API_KEY=your_irs_api_key
IRS_API_URL=https://api.irs.gov
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Starting Onboarding Process

```tsx
// Navigate to onboarding
navigate('/onboarding');

// The wizard will guide users through all 11 steps
// Progress is automatically saved and can be resumed
```

### Admin Review Management

```tsx
// Access admin dashboard
navigate('/admin/onboarding-reviews');

// View pending reviews, assign to reviewers, and make decisions
```

### Compliance Scoring

```tsx
// The system automatically calculates scores based on:
const score = await calculateScore(formData);

// Scores are updated in real-time as users complete steps
// Automatic approval/rejection based on thresholds
```

## üîß Customization

### Scoring Algorithm

Modify the scoring logic in `useComplianceScoring.ts`:

```tsx
const calculateFmcsaScore = (formData: FormData): number => {
  // Customize FMCSA scoring logic
  if (!formData.fmcsa_verified) return 0;
  
  switch (formData.fmcsa_safety_rating) {
    case 'satisfactory':
      return 20;
    case 'conditional':
      return 15;
    default:
      return 10;
  }
};
```

### Document Requirements

Update required documents in the database schema:

```sql
-- Add new document types
ALTER TABLE legal_acknowledgments 
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_agreement_types 
CHECK (agreement_type IN (
  'broker_carrier_agreement', 
  'terms_of_use', 
  'privacy_policy',
  'custom_agreement' -- Add your custom types
));
```

### Approval Thresholds

Modify approval logic in the database functions:

```sql
-- Update auto-approval thresholds
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.auto_approve_onboarding(p_company_profile_id UUID)
RETURNS TEXT
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Customize your approval logic
  IF current_score >= 110 THEN  -- Increase threshold
    approval_status := 'auto_approved';
  ELSIF current_score >= 80 THEN  -- Adjust manual review threshold
    approval_status := 'manual_review';
  ELSE
    approval_status := 'rejected';
  END IF;
  
  RETURN approval_status;
END;
$$;
```
