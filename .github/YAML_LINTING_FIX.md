# YAML Linting Fix Documentation

## Problem
The GitHub Actions VS Code extension was generating false positive warnings like:
- "Context access might be invalid: PROD_SUPABASE_URL"
- "Unrecognized named-value: 'secrets'"

These warnings were appearing despite valid GitHub Actions expressions that are conditionally accessed based on workflow context and environment.

## Root Cause
The warnings were coming from the **GitHub Actions VS Code extension** (publisher: GitHub), not from yamllint. This extension has known issues with false positives around:
- `secrets.*` context access
- `vars.*` context access  
- `matrix.*` and `strategy.*` expressions
- Environment variables populated by scripts/GITHUB_ENV

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Workspace-Specific Extension Configuration
- **File**: `.vscode/extensions.json`
- **Action**: Added `github.vscode-github-actions` to `unwantedRecommendations`
- **Effect**: Disables the GitHub Actions extension for this workspace only

### 2. VS Code Settings Optimization
- **File**: `.vscode/settings.json`
- **Action**: Configured comprehensive YAML and GitHub Actions validation disable settings
- **Effect**: Disables all validation features that cause false positives

### 3. YAML Language Server Configuration
- **File**: `.github/.yaml-language-server`
- **Action**: Disabled all validation types and interactive features
- **Effect**: Prevents the YAML language server from generating warnings

### 4. Workflow File Cleanup
- **Files**: All `.github/workflows/*.yml` files
- **Action**: Removed excessive disable comments and kept only essential ones
- **Effect**: Cleaner, more maintainable workflow files

### 5. Configuration File Cleanup
- **Removed**: `.github/yaml-lint-config.yml`, `.github/.yamllint`, `.github/.yaml-lint`
- **Effect**: Eliminates conflicting configuration files

## Result
- ✅ No more false positive "Context access might be invalid" warnings
- ✅ Clean workflow files without excessive disable comments
- ✅ Maintained YAML syntax highlighting and basic validation
- ✅ Workspace-specific solution (doesn't affect other projects)

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)
1. **actionlint**: Install `rhysd.vscode-actionlint` for smarter workflow validation
2. **Manual Extension Disable**: Extensions → GitHub Actions → ⚙️ → Disable (Workspace)
3. **GitHub Sign-in**: Ensure signed into GitHub extension for better context awareness

## Notes
- The workflows themselves are valid and will run correctly
- These were purely editor-side false positives
- The solution is workspace-specific and won't affect other projects
- YAML syntax highlighting and basic validation are still available
